This is dataset comprising of the top 1000 Instagram follower dataset, I’m excited to share the insights and charts that I got from the mini project. 
The tool used for the analysis of the data is Microsoft excel as it offers easy to use features and scalable charts. 
The dataset was obtained from kaggle (the link), and it’s a data that was gathered in September so it can be said to be fairly recent. 
The data contains 11 columns and 10001 rows, the columns includes; country, rank, account, title, Link, category, followers, audience country, Authentic Engagement, Engagement Avg, Scrapped.
